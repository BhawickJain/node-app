A waltkhrough of developing a full node-app within docker and making a scalable api-database with MongoDb and Nginx. The repo represents a minimal annotated example.

`[?]` Why commit the `package-lock.json` file?
`>>>` The goal of `package-lock`.json is keep an exact track of the versions used for every package [[node-doc-packagelock](https://nodejs.dev/learn/the-package-lock-json-file)]. When you `npm install` your `package.json`, any packages that follow [semver](https://semver.org) notation will be subject upgrade even if the last version was great. `package-lock.json` stops that, and npm simply installs the last version that worked whenever there is ambiguity. It also means that if you want to `npm update`, it will update all the package to latest version as limited by semver. Those updates are then reflected in the `package-lock`.json. Also mean don't have to commit a fat `node_modules` folder either.  

### Starting from Scratch with Docker

The follow settings for `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yaml` was super useful to jump in and build out the project.

```Dockerfile
FROM node:16
WORKDIR /app
RUN npm install â€”no-cache
```

```yaml
services:
  node-app:
    build: .
    # keep container from exiting
    stdin_open: true
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
    volumes:
      - ./app:/app
```

From here `docker compose up --build` and jump inside to install all the packages with `docker compose exec node-app /bin/bash`. Since there is a bind mount, the `./app` wille develop. Ensure you create a named or anonymous volume mount for `app/node_modules` and delete it from your local `app/` folder. Also ensure you ignore all files not required.

You can save yourself by simply clone this project and use the docker cli commands to jump right in and build out.

`[?]` Why do you need to `COPY . ./` if you have a bind mount?  
`>>>` The bind mount is only there to support the development process. and will not be used in production. 

`[?]` Can you and why would you set the `./app:/app` bind as read only from container's end?  
`>>>` Generally for security but will mean that you're using `npm` command in your local machine instead of within the docker container. Since everything is being managed from the container, it is a reasonable gamble to keep the volume mount for read write (`rw`). However if you do can to set it the following snippet shows you how.
```yaml
services:
  node-app:
    [...]
      volumes:
        # volume mount as read only
        - ./app:/app:ro
```

### Environment variables

```Dockerfile
[...]
ENV PORT 3000
[...]
```

This means that within our linux container, there is now an environment variable exported that can grabbed by our node-app:
```bash
printenv
```

Allows express to get the PORT number to listen on with:
```javascript
const port = process.env.port || 3000;
```

This is a standard practice for the Heroku Twelve Factor app development [[so-portenv](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18864677/what-is-process-env-port-in-node-js)]. Technically, since this port is internal container  port number it should not matter too much, the port binding however is more important. In certain deployments where you can't have a port binding as such, this configuration is critical.

It is generally better to have a `.env` file to keep all your environemtn variables separated.
```env
PORT=4000
```
Change the `docker-compile accordingly`
```yaml
services:
  [...]
  node-app:
    [...]
      env-file:
        - .env
      ports:
        - 3000:${PORT}
```
It is the equivalent to `docker run --env-file=FILE -p 3000:4000...` in the docker cli.

`[ ]` What is the docker compose equivalent of this?  

`[?]` How can you access node.js REPL mode from your CLI?  
`>>>` `docker compose exec node-app node`  

You cannot scale a container if it has a custom `container_name` option in the `docker-compose.yaml` file [[dkr-docs-conname](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#container_name)].
